- This pattern focuses on managing state transitions and coordinating state-specific behaviors.
- If we have to change the behavior of an object based on its state, we can have a state variable in the Object. Then use if-else condition block to perform different actions based on the state. StateImplementation.State design pattern is used to provide a systematic and loosely coupled way to achieve this through Context and StateImplementation.State implementations. StateImplementation.State Pattern Context is the class that has a StateImplementation.State reference to one of the concrete implementations of the StateImplementation.State. Context forwards the request to the state object for processing.
