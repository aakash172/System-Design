* The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. It primarily deals with the interaction and communication between objects, specifically focusing on how objects behave in response to changes in the state of other objects.

Below are some key points about observer design pattern:
- Note: Subjects are the objects that maintain and notify observers about changes in their state, while Observers are the entities that react to those changes.
- Defines how a group of objects (observers) interact based on changes in the state of a subject.
- Observers react to changes in the subject’s state.
- The subject doesn’t need to know the specific classes of its observers, allowing for flexibility.
- Observers can be easily added or removed without affecting the subject
