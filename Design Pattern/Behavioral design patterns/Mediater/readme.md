- A mediator design pattern is one of the important and widely used behavioral design patterns. Mediator enables the decoupling of objects by introducing a layer in between so that the interaction between objects happens via the layer
- Mediator pattern focuses on provide a mediator between objects for communication and help in implementing lose-coupling between objects. Air traffic controller is a great example of mediator pattern where the airport control room works as a mediator for communication between different flights. Mediator works as a router between objects and it can have itâ€™s own logic to provide way of communication. The system objects that communicate each other are called Colleagues. Usually we have an interface or abstract class that provides the contract for communication and then we have concrete implementation of mediators.
