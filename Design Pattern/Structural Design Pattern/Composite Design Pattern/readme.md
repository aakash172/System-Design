* The composite pattern in software engineering is a partitioning design pattern, treating a group of objects similarly to a single instance of the same object type. It facilitates the creation of tree structures representing part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to interact uniformly with individual objects and compositions. This pattern is part of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, aiming to solve recurring design problems for flexible and reusable object-oriented software.
# Implementation of Composite Design Pattern

The Composite Design Pattern consists of four main components:

- **Component**
    - Serves as the base interface for all objects in the composition.
    - Can be an interface or an abstract class with common methods to manage child components.

- **Leaf**
    - Implements the default behavior of the base component.
    - Does not contain references to other objects.

- **Composite**
    - Contains leaf elements and manages their composition.
    - Implements the base component methods and defines operations related to child elements.

- **Client**
    - Interacts with the composition elements through the base component object.
